# fillit @ 42
Can you feel it?

Group project with fmaury

The purpose is to make the smallest possible "square" (which can contain holes)
with a given list of tetriminos, but the disposition must be as such that it 
returns the first possible solution when placing them recursively from the top 
left.

## Compiling
Run `make`, an executable called `fillit` should compile directly.

## Usage
```sh
./fillit [file]
```
